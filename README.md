# Student-Management-System-Java
This is my open ended project a Student Management System. It uses DERBY Database and has two login types namely: Admin and Student. Student has option to view data and select subjects and see marks. Admin can add students, delete and update student records. Admin is also responsible for adding student marks once the student has selected the subjects.
